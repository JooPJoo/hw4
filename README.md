P&amp;E Homework 4

How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
The amount of lines drawn each frame depends on the parameters set in the "for" loop.  In this case, the first line starts at 10 pixels from the left side of the canvas and lines are produced at an increment of 10 pixels to the right, ending at the width of the canvas subtracting 10 pixels; a total of 35 lines.

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
The first number 10 represents the initial starting point of the first line in the x-axis.  The second appearance refers to the ending postition of the last line in the x-axis and the last appearance is the incrementing factor of 10 pixels apart from each line.

Arrays and a loop

How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
Usually it should be 60 frames per second.

What are the two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
By either changing the increment value or changing the shape variables x, y.

How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
By ioncreasing the x and y slice values.
